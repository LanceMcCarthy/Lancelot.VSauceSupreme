# VSauce Supreme
A Windows App Studio generated application experiment that aggregated all the VSauce channels into one app. It is very likely that this project will not build correctly (you do need ApiKeys at a minimum), the main purpose of putting it on GitHub is to preserve the very useful infrastructure and helper code the App Studio generated in the class libraries. 

There is a ton of great coding practices examples and helper classes in here, do not reinvent the wheel :)
